### Project

This project was a group effort - 6 individual contributors worked to create a RISC-V R10K processor. Equipped with register renaming, data and hazard handling, 

We also built in several advanced features: n-way superscalar, early branch resolution, branch prediction using GShare, instruction cache, instruction prefetching, and data cache. 

We achieved a 8.6ns clock period.
